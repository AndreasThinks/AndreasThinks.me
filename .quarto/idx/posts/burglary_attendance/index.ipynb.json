I'll use this post to explore open police data from the last decade, and use data from pilot forces to see just how dramatic the effect is: **just what's happened to burglary, and will mandatory attendance help?**\n\n\nWe'll start by exploring how burglary has changed over time - for the purpose of this analysis, we're focusing on domestic burglary (eg, non including commercial properties), and we'll use both police recorded crime data (eg, crimes reported to police) and the Crime Survey of England and Wales (a national survey to measure total crime) to compare trends.\n\n::: {.callout-note collapse=\"true\"}\n### On Data Quality\n\nWhile the UK benefits from crime data that is comparatively clean (I do not envy our American cousins, let alone most of our colleagues in the rest of the world), this is less true for both historical data (eg, going back more than a few years) or the Crime Survey data, which [isn't readily available to the general public](https://www.crimesurvey.co.uk/en/SurveyResults.html): the data is spread through various archive files, websites and reports, and there really isn't a \"single source of truth\" for crime counts over time.\n\nThe data for this analysis is a few hacked togther files:\n- Crime outcomes and crime counts by quarter, manually concatenated from the [Police Open Data Tables](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/police-recorded-crime-open-data-tables)\n- Crime Survey burglary counts per year, from the most recent [ONS crime and justice quarterly](https://www.ons.gov.uk/generator?uri=/peoplepopulationandcommunity/crimeandjustice/bulletins/crimeinenglandandwales/yearendingjune2022/153cc78c&format=csv)\n\nI'm afraid that does mean this analysis isn't quite as reproducible as I'd like - I had written some code to scrape the Home Office data page and aggregate all the outcomes data, but it's such a mishmash of ODS,XLSX and various formats that everything fell over and I did it manually.  That said, hopefully it's not too much of a pain to reproduce if you feel the need to. \n\nA few caveats are worth considering:\n\n1. The Crime Survey can't always be easily compared to reported crime: police crime data is legal accounting, while the crime survey is asking the general public what happened.  Domestic Burglary *should* be comparable, but this is all a little experimental.\n2. Reproducibility and data cleaning: good analysis should be reproducible - you should be able to run it the same way, with new data. This isn't true here because of my ugly cleaning.\n3. Outcomes aren't instant: Crimes take time to solve, and so the most recent outcomes data will probably change. I've used outcomes per quarter, which *should* work, but the most recent data is likely to change.\n\n\n:::\n\n\nThe Crime Survey data is the best measure for long term crime trends - as it isn't affected by reporting or policing practice. Taken in isolation, the most obvious takeaway here is that **burglary is lower than it's every been**. If you acccept the Peelian view that [\"the test of police efficiency is the absence of crime and disorder\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Peel), policing is doing an excellent job. So why is police reported crime comparatively high, and why are perceptions of police performance seemingly so low?\n\n\nComparing Crime Survey to Police Recorded crime counts is generally considered bad form: while a police officer might always know the difference between a robbery, a burglary, and an affray to enable a theft, that's not something most of the public worries about.\n\nThankfully, that shouldn't be a problem for domestic burglary - most people know when they've been burgled! That means we can produce **a ratio of crime survey burglaries to police burglaries, and obtain a rough estimate of what proportion of burglaries are reported to police over time.**\n\n\nI'd once thought burglary reporting would be consistent - it's an emotive crime, with a well established insurance industry - and yet we definitely see variation over time.\n\nNotice that dramatic spike in 2015? That's the aftermath of the 2014 police crime recording scandal, which led to police crime statistics [losing their designation as a national statistic](https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/jan/15/police-crime-figures-status-claims-fiddling), and accurate crime recording [becoming a key metric for the policing regulator.](https://www.justiceinspectorates.gov.uk/hmicfrs/our-work/article/crime-data-integrity/crime-recording-process/) To dig into this issue in more depth, I'd really recommend this blog by [Gavin Hales](https://www.police-foundation.org.uk/2018/03/crime-blame-police-crime-survey-england-wales-tells-us-police-crime-recording-practices-exposes-limitations/).\n\n\nWhat does this tell us about burglary in England & Wales over the last decade though? Two things:\n\n1. **Domestic Burglaries are probably rarer than ever** (and that's not down to COVID)\n2. That's **not consistently reflected in police recorded crime** - the likelihood of reporting seems to change over time\n\n## How Many Burglars are we Catching?\n\nSo there aren't many burglaries...so have we gotten better at catching the rest?\n\nWell...we're certainly not catching any more than we used to. Whether you use charges (eg, burglars being sent to court) or \"detections\" (eg, including cautions, fines and similar), there are far fewer, thought it looks like that trend started long before 2015.\n\n\n\nThat's not hugely surprising: there are fewer burglars around to be caught. What's perhaps more important is how many burglars we're catching **as a proportion of those remaining burglaries we know about**.\n\nI've visualised that below: on the left axis, all police reported burglaries (in blue), and how many lead to a positive outcome (in red), and on the right axis, the ratio of the two: an estimate of the proportion of police burglaries that are \"solved\".\n\n\nIt doesn't look good:  performance drops sharply around the time we stopped attending all burglaries in 2015.\n\nOf course, plenty of other things happened in 2015: for instance, we know there was a radical shift in recording standards, where police recorded and invesigated thousands of burglaries which they would have previously not been aware of. So how do we measure how police performance changed irrespective of those recording changes? We can replicate that chart, but instead of using police recorded burglaries, we use *all* burglaries, as reported by the Crime Survey. rather than just police reported burglaries.\n\nThe below chart does exactly that - click on each of the buttons to see how the baseline figure affects perceived investigatory performance.\n\n\nSuddenly that sharp drop in 2015 is a lot less convincing. Looking at all burglaries - rather than just those reported to police - the proportion being solved has been going down, but **that started happening long before 2015**. Around 5% of all burglaries in the crime survey were \"solved\" in 2010, but by 2015, that had already dropped to around 2.5%, compared to just over 2% in 2020.\n\nWhat's the lesson here? The perception of a recent, short term drop in police investigative performance are somewhat overstated. Yes, policing is catching fewer burglars than ever, but burglaries are rarer than ever - those that remain are less likely to be caught than they used to be, but that's a trend that started long before 2015 (it might even have started as early as 2008).\n\nWhat explains that trend?  We really don't know.  It's possible that those few remaining burglars are the most persistent and sophisiticated: maybe opportunistic drug users desperate for a fix who were willing to smash your front window in a decade ago have been replaced by professional teams who will do a whole set of flats in minutes. **We can't really tell with the data we've got here, but it's probably not as simple as policing just not trying hard enough.**\n\n## Will Mandatory Attendance Help?\n\nGiven the above, will mandatory attendance actually reduce burglary? As far as I can tell, nobody has properly checked. [The Telegraph suggests that burglaries \"could fall by 60pc if officers visited every victim\"](https://t.co/jTkytsD1HX), but given nobody has really rigorously tested the impact of burglary attendance, I'm not totally convinced. Leicestershire [attempted to conduct a randomised control trial in 2015, but following press uproar the whole thing was shelved](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-leicestershire-33788264).\n\nThere is some good research that suggests it will make *some* difference: [rapid attendance to crimes probably does help solve them](https://policinginsight.com/features/analysis/double-crewing-and-faster-response-times-are-key-to-cutting-crime-and-costs-while-improving-service/), and [finding a suspect is the most effective way of solving a burglary](https://academic.oup.com/policing/article-abstract/15/2/832/5359499). If we randomly assigned some burglaries to be attended, and some to not, those we did attend would be solved more often.\n\nThat's different to mandatory attendance though: where even if the responding officer thinks there isn't any point (for example, if the burglary was many months ago, or very unlikely to be solved following a phone report), they'll attend anyway. So how have some reporters calculcated that policy could [cut the number of offences by half?](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-10392721/Sending-police-officers-burglaries-cuts-number-offences-half-forces-find.html)\n\nUnhelpfully, the researchers for the [Mail](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-10392721/Sending-police-officers-burglaries-cuts-number-offences-half-forces-find.html) and the [Telegraph](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2022/10/05/burglaries-could-fall-60pc-officers-visited-every-victim/) haven't been very open with sharing their methodology, but it looks like they've looked at those forces who already have a mandatory attendance policy, and tried to predict what would happen if that had been expanded nationally.\n\nThree forces in particular are repeatedly mentioned as having introduced mandatory attendance prior to the NPCC mandate:\n\n1. [Northamptonshire since April 2019](https://www.northants.police.uk/news/northants/news/news/2022/april/burglaries-in-northamptonshire-reduce-by-more-than-half-as-burglary-team-turns-three-years-old/), though it's worth noting these are dedicated burglary teams rather than attendance in isolation\n2. [Bedfordshire Police](https://www.itv.com/news/anglia/2022-01-14/bedfordshire-burglaries-halve-thanks-to-new-police-task-force) using the codename \"Operation Maze\", though again, it seems paired with dedicated burglary teams, and may in fact be attendance by forensics staff rather than police offiers.  The [earliest records are in early 2020](https://twitter.com/bedspolice/status/1231927872035618817) but it's not clear at all this involves any mandatory attendance, rather than just increased resourcing.\n3. [Greater Manchester Police](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/greater-manchester-news/police-to-attend-all-burglaries-25180398) since [July 2021](https://www.gmp.police.uk/news/greater-manchester/news/news/2022/october/15-months-committed-to-attending-every-burglary/)\n\nThe key question then is **did the introduction of mandatory attendance in these three forces make any difference to burglary investigations?**\n\nTo do that, we'll calculate:\n- What was the detection rate for burglary in all forces?\n- How did the detection rate change after the introduction of mandatory attendance?\n- How did other, similar forces fare during the same period?\n\n\nThere are real limitations to doing this with public data: we are limited to quarter by quarter analysis, and we don't actually know exactly when these policies started (or, for that matter, exactly what they include) or who else might have been doing something similar, but we can still try and identify what performance boost (if any) mandatory attendance made for these forces.\n\n\n\nGiven we're looking at quarterly data, we'll generate two temporal variables for our data:\n\n1. A running variable (running_var), which measures the number of quarters that have passed since the start of our dataset\n2. A quarter \"categorical variable\", checking to see if there is any specific trend for burglary detection whether you're in quarter 1, 2, 3 or 4 \n\n\nFor each force, we then have a count of burglaries, and a ratio of how many solved burglaries (eg, burglary investigations where a burglary is identified and dealt with by police) we have that quarter.\n\nNow, we identify our \"treated\" forces, and the period in which the policy was in place. This isn't exactly clean, but based on the newspaper articles and press releases, I've picked out:\n\n- Bedfordshire from 2020 onwards\n- GMP from July 2021 onwards\n- Northamptonshire from April 2019 onwards\n- and of course, nationwide from October 2022\n\nWith those dates, we'll then build our completed dataset of quarter by quarter burglary detection rates, for each force, and whether or not a mandatory attendance policy was in place in that force/quarter.\n\n\nOne limitation of working by quarters is that we're quite limited in numbers! Good inference in statistical modelling relies on detecting \"variance\" - eg, having enough data to identify both our effect, and general background levels, and separating out the two.  Given GMP has only been running for 6 quarters, we'll focus on the other two forces for this analysis.\n\n\nNow we can start combining our data together, and seeing if we can observe any meaningful difference after the intervention takes place.\n\nFor meaningful comparisons, we'll seek to compare forces to other similar forces - there's not much point in comparing GMP to Durham. We could do that with our existing data - eg, looking at forces with similar numbers of burglaries - but helpfully, the policing regulator [HMIFRS already produces \"Most Similar Forces\" groups](https://www.justiceinspectorates.gov.uk/hmicfrs/police-forces/data/), which should let us match up forces based on size, demographics and other factors relevant to performance. We'll seperate out our group A (Bedfordshire and their group) from group B (Northamptonshire's), though notice Kent is in both - unhelpfully, HMIC's groups aren't exclusive, though that's not too much of a problem.\n\nLet's start with a simple visual observation: we look at the rate of detection per outcome for each force and group, with the start of mandatory attendance visible as the dashed vertical line.\n\n\nIt looks, in a word, messy.  There *might* be some sort of effect, but it certainly isn't pronounced enough to visually observe. Instead, let's use some statistical modelling to try and measure the average effect.\n\n## Statistical Modelling\n### Linear Models with Time Effects\n\n\nWith all our data, we now build a statistical model, predicting the detected outcome rate as a factor of force, their comparison group, their total offences, and the period in time.\n\n\n\nOur model suggests that mandatory attendance may have had, on average, a small effect on performance, this was not significant - eg, it may have been down to sheer luck.\n\nLet's go a bit further, and add a interaction effect between time and our force variable - eg, accounting for the fact that performance may vary differently over time force, by force.\n\nNo matter how we model it, we're again not finding meaningful effects - mandatory attendance does seem to be associated with slightly higher detected rates, on average, but this isn't statistically significant.  Put simply, examining the \"statistical noise\" in the rest of our model, we can't confidently say any increases aren't just due to random luck.\n\nAs one final approach, we'll use panel data using the [LinearModels library](https://bashtage.github.io/linearmodels/) - far from the best way to examine how effects change over  time, but not a bad starter for ten.\n\nA similar pattern emerges - we see a small increase associated with mandatory attendance, but it's non-significant - the increases are too small or too random to say the effect is associated due to attendance, rather than just random data noise.\n\nThat said, there are plenty of issues with our approach! We've only tried straightforward linear approaches, and given we're relying on two forces and quarterly data, we'd struggle to detect small effects... hopefully we'll notice something more stark when I come back to this in a few months for **part 2, time series approaches!**\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\nIt's nearly 2023, and in the true spirit of Christmas, I've used the cheese/wine filled nowhere time between the holidays to pick up an analytical side-project that's been irking me for awhile... what's happened to burglary, and why are we suddenly so excited about mandatory attendance?

The perception of a recent, short term drop in police investigative performance are somewhat overstated. Yes, policing is catching fewer burglars than ever, but burglaries are rarer than ever - those that remain are less likely to be caught than they used to be, but that's a trend that started long before 2015 (it might even have started as early as 2008).\n\nWhat explains that trend?  We really don't know.  It's possible that those few remaining burglars are the most persistent and sophisiticated: maybe opportunistic drug users desperate for a fix who were willing to smash your front window in a decade ago have been replaced by professional teams who will do a whole set of flats in minutes. **We can't really tell with the data we've got here, but it's probably not as simple as policing just not trying hard enough.**\n\n## Will Mandatory Attendance Help?\n\nGiven the above, will mandatory attendance actually reduce burglary? As far as I can tell, nobody has properly checked. [The Telegraph suggests that burglaries \"could fall by 60pc if officers visited every victim\"](https://t.co/jTkytsD1HX), but given nobody has really rigorously tested the impact of burglary attendance, I'm not totally convinced. Leicestershire [attempted to conduct a randomised control trial in 2015, but following press uproar the whole thing was shelved](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-leicestershire-33788264).\n\nThere is some good research that suggests it will make *some* difference: [rapid attendance to crimes probably does help solve them](https://policinginsight.com/features/analysis/double-crewing-and-faster-response-times-are-key-to-cutting-crime-and-costs-while-improving-service/), and [finding a suspect is the most effective way of solving a burglary](https://academic.oup.com/policing/article-abstract/15/2/832/5359499). If we randomly assigned some burglaries to be attended, and some to not, those we did attend would be solved more often.\n\nThat's different to mandatory attendance though: where even if the responding officer thinks there isn't any point (for example, if the burglary was many months ago, or very unlikely to be solved following a phone report), they'll attend anyway. So how have some reporters calculcated that policy could [cut the number of offences by half?](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-10392721/Sending-police-officers-burglaries-cuts-number-offences-half-forces-find.html)\n\nUnhelpfully, the researchers for the [Mail](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-10392721/Sending-police-officers-burglaries-cuts-number-offences-half-forces-find.html) and the [Telegraph](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2022/10/05/burglaries-could-fall-60pc-officers-visited-every-victim/) haven't been very open with sharing their methodology, but it looks like they've looked at those forces who already have a mandatory attendance policy, and tried to predict what would happen if that had been expanded nationally.\n\nThree forces in particular are repeatedly mentioned as having introduced mandatory attendance prior to the NPCC mandate:\n\n1. [Northamptonshire since April 2019](https://www.northants.police.uk/news/northants/news/news/2022/april/burglaries-in-northamptonshire-reduce-by-more-than-half-as-burglary-team-turns-three-years-old/), though it's worth noting these are dedicated burglary teams rather than attendance in isolation\n2. [Bedfordshire Police](https://www.itv.com/news/anglia/2022-01-14/bedfordshire-burglaries-halve-thanks-to-new-police-task-force) using the codename \"Operation Maze\", though again, it seems paired with dedicated burglary teams, and may in fact be attendance by forensics staff rather than police offiers.  The [earliest records are in early 2020](https://twitter.com/bedspolice/status/1231927872035618817) but it's not clear at all this involves any mandatory attendance, rather than just increased resourcing.\n3. [Greater Manchester Police](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/greater-manchester-news/police-to-attend-all-burglaries-25180398) since [July 2021](https://www.gmp.police.uk/news/greater-manchester/news/news/2022/october/15-months-committed-to-attending-every-burglary/)\n\nThe key question then is **did the introduction of mandatory attendance in these three forces make any difference to burglary investigations?**\n\nTo do that, we'll calculate:\n- What was the detection rate for burglary in all forces?\n- How did the detection rate change after the introduction of mandatory attendance?\n- How did other, similar forces fare during the same period?\n\n\nThere are real limitations to doing this with public data: we are limited to quarter by quarter analysis, and we don't actually know exactly when these policies started (or, for that matter, exactly what they include) or who else might have been doing something similar, but we can still try and identify what performance boost (if any) mandatory attendance made for these forces.\n\n\n\nGiven we're looking at quarterly data, we'll generate two temporal variables for our data:\n\n1. A running variable (running_var), which measures the number of quarters that have passed since the start of our dataset\n2. A quarter \"categorical variable\", checking to see if there is any specific trend for burglary detection whether you're in quarter 1, 2, 3 or 4 \n\n\nFor each force, we then have a count of burglaries, and a ratio of how many solved burglaries (eg, burglary investigations where a burglary is identified and dealt with by police) we have that quarter.\n\nNow, we identify our \"treated\" forces, and the period in which the policy was in place. This isn't exactly clean, but based on the newspaper articles and press releases, I've picked out:\n\n- Bedfordshire from 2020 onwards\n- GMP from July 2021 onwards\n- Northamptonshire from April 2019 onwards\n- and of course, nationwide from October 2022\n\nWith those dates, we'll then build our completed dataset of quarter by quarter burglary detection rates, for each force, and whether or not a mandatory attendance policy was in place in that force/quarter.\n\n\nOne limitation of working by quarters is that we're quite limited in numbers! Good inference in statistical modelling relies on detecting \"variance\" - eg, having enough data to identify both our effect, and general background levels, and separating out the two.  Given GMP has only been running for 6 quarters, we'll focus on the other two forces for this analysis.\n\n\nNow we can start combining our data together, and seeing if we can observe any meaningful difference after the intervention takes place.\n\nFor meaningful comparisons, we'll seek to compare forces to other similar forces - there's not much point in comparing GMP to Durham. We could do that with our existing data - eg, looking at forces with similar numbers of burglaries - but helpfully, the policing regulator [HMIFRS already produces \"Most Similar Forces\" groups](https://www.justiceinspectorates.gov.uk/hmicfrs/police-forces/data/), which should let us match up forces based on size, demographics and other factors relevant to performance. We'll seperate out our group A (Bedfordshire and their group) from group B (Northamptonshire's), though notice Kent is in both - unhelpfully, HMIC's groups aren't exclusive, though that's not too much of a problem.\n\nLet's start with a simple visual observation: we look at the rate of detection per outcome for each force and group, with the start of mandatory attendance visible as the dashed vertical line.\n\n\nIt looks, in a word, messy.  There *might* be some sort of effect, but it certainly isn't pronounced enough to visually observe. Instead, let's use some statistical modelling to try and measure the average effect.\n\n## Statistical Modelling\n### Linear Models with Time Effects\n\n\nWith all our data, we now build a statistical model, predicting the detected outcome rate as a factor of force, their comparison group, their total offences, and the period in time.\n\n\n\nOur model suggests that mandatory attendance may have had, on average, a small effect on performance, this was not significant - eg, it may have been down to sheer luck.\n\nLet's go a bit further, and add a interaction effect between time and our force variable - eg, accounting for the fact that performance may vary differently over time force, by force.\n\nNo matter how we model it, we're again not finding meaningful effects - mandatory attendance does seem to be associated with slightly higher detected rates, on average, but this isn't statistically significant.  Put simply, examining the \"statistical noise\" in the rest of our model, we can't confidently say any increases aren't just due to random luck.\n\nAs one final approach, we'll use panel data using the [LinearModels library](https://bashtage.github.io/linearmodels/) - far from the best way to examine how effects change over  time, but not a bad starter for ten.\n\nA similar pattern emerges - we see a small increase associated with mandatory attendance, but it's non-significant - the increases are too small or too random to say the effect is associated due to attendance, rather than just random data noise.\n\nThat said, there are plenty of issues with our approach! We've only tried straightforward linear approaches, and given we're relying on two forces and quarterly data, we'd struggle to detect small effects... hopefully we'll notice something more stark when I come back to this in a few months for **part 2, time series approaches!**\n"},"formats":{"html":{"identifier":{"display-name":"HTML","target-format":"html","base-format":"html"},"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":true,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":false,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"ipynb-shell-interactivity":null,"plotly-connected":true,"engine":"jupyter"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-typ":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":true,"code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"inline-includes":false,"preserve-yaml":false,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-min-runs":1,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[],"notebook-links":true},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","css":["../../styles.css"],"output-file":"index.html"},"language":{"toc-title-document":"Table
