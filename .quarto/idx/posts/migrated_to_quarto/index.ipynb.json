After much back and forth over a decent blogging platform, I think I've finally found a decent, well maintained home ... meet [Quarto!](https://quarto.org/)\n\nSo, what did I want from a blogging platform, and why did it take so long to get here?\n\n- Easily maintained, static pages (no paying for fancy maintained services^[There are plenty of fancy companies that probably advertise on your favourite podcast or Youtube video, but I wanted to keep it simple.])\n- Native(ish) support for [Python Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) notebooks and [RMarkdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) \n- Support for both technical writing (functions, code, citations) and interactive elements\n- Make it pretty!\n\nSo, does it work?  Is it pretty? It's *gorgeous*.\n\n![Gorgeous pictures! With Alt Text!](unsplash.jpg){fig-alt=\"A picture of a red computer chip.\"}\n\nI've tried a variety of options over the past few years (notably [Pelican](https://getpelican.com/), [Nikola](https://getnikola.com/) and [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/)) but none of them have quite fit the bill\n\n::: {.column-margin}\nI eventually settled on Nikola because of how consistenly it handled Jupyter, but found RMarkdown support a pain, and it wasn't quite as well maintained and documented as I would have liked.\n:::\n\nYou've probably also noted some of the niftier other features of Quarto sprinkled through this, especially for technical writing... callouts, citations, bibliographies ahoy!\n\n:::{.callout-note collapse=\"true\"}\nI've been using Obsidian to manage my personal notes for a few months, and being able to make notes gorgeous and functional has been a real pleasure...now I can share that with everyone else!\n:::\n\nWith native support for interactive Jupyter widgets, I'm looking forward to seeing just how many plots and maps I can show off... It's a really promising start! I haven't got anything too much to show for now, so instead check out this nifty, automatically generated plot.\n\n```{mermaid}\nflowchart LR\n  A[Interactive plot?] --> B(Excited audience...)\n  B --> C[Excitement!]\n  B --> D[Confusion!]\n```\n\nHopefully this is the first post of many on my new and improved blog, and I hope you enjoy it!\n"},"formats":{"html":{"identifier":{"display-name":"HTML","target-format":"html"},"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":true,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":false,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"jupyter"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[],"notebook-links":true,"format-links":true},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","css":["../../styles.css"],"output-file":"index.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.3.78","theme":"cyborg","title-block-banner":true,"title":"I've migrated to Quarto!","description":"I've migrated to a fancy new technical writing platform, and I'm a little in love with it","date":"2022-09-27","categories":["news"]},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}}}}
