As such, I've had to use a combination of the [GetOldTweets library](https://pypi.org/project/GetOldTweets3/) and then Tweepy to extract the biography data. As such, this does need access to the Twitter API and a developer account (though I found that quite easy to get).\n<!-- TEASER_END -->\n\n\nIn this case, I've put together a query that pulls all tweets directed to the MPS username between set dates.  I'd warn that even using GetOldTweets, pull too many tweets at once and Twitter will kick you out - I found that especially during especially active social media days, I had to add a delay to my code.\n\nWith that all done, you can pull out a list of all your tweets that day, as well a the userbiography.  \n\n## Coding and Learning\nThis is the painful bit: I had to manually go through a few hundred tweets and manually label them as \"Right Wing\" or not based on my own hunches.  \n\nI went with the below\n\n\n*   Anti-immigration sentiment\n*   Anti-socialism/BLM\n*   Pro-Brexit/Anti-EU\n*   Pro-Trump/MAGA\n\nThe coded set can be found below.\n\n\n\n\nFastAI includes the very convenient concept of a \"DataLoader\": a python object that combines all the data you're working with, split into a training and test set, in a format it can work with. \n\nFor text classication, that object does a lot of the heavy lifting for you. NLP normally requires an awful lot of data-cleaning: you break your text into words, then add special characters to capitalisation, sentence starts, etc. As you can see below, FastAI has done *all of that* in a few lines of code. The down-side is, I'm not hugely clear exactly what it's done, or how I can now read my text.\n\nThis is the fun bit: learning. Notice hear we aren't starting from scracth: we call the \"fine_tune\" function, because fastAI already contains a model trained on text.\n\nNow, we can start predicting! FastAI will take any bundle of text and tell you whether it thinks it's right wing or not (based on my coding).  If I'm entirely honest, this doesn't work fantastically - it seems to have decided that the phrase \"Justice for\" is essentially a right wing calling card, which I'm not entirely comfortable with.  That said, the process works!  Ish.  \n\n## The Prototype\nSo, can we convert all this into a working application?  Sure!  Ish. My combining my tweet extractor with sentiment analysis of the tweet text itself (I found [this medium blog post](https://medium.com/better-programming/twitter-sentiment-analysis-15d8892c0082) very helpful) we can analyse for any specific day, the volume of tweets flagged as \"right wing\", and contrast them to the overall messaging, and compare their \"Subjectivity (how subjective or opinionated the text is — a score of 0 is fact, and a score of +1 is very much an opinion) and the other to get the tweets called Polarity (how positive or negative the text is, — score of -1 is the highest negative score, and a score of +1 is the highest positive score)\".\n\nWhile I would have loved to deploy this to Heroku or Binder using Voila, the Pytorch text classification model annoying takes far over 500mb of space, so neither free option will support it - it does look like you can chose to use the CPU pytorch option instead, but frankly it's painful to get the implementation working! \n\n### Helper Functions\nWe start by bringing together all my previous code (as well as some rough sentiment analysis of the text itself) into one chunk, then added widgets.\n\n### The Product\nFinally, my working product - given a user-name and two dates, it will pull all tweets on those dates, run the sentiment analysis, show the ratio of right-wing tweets, and the sentiment on those. Here I've specifically picked the day Dawn Butler was stopped by police, and notice how right wing \n"},"formats":{"html":{"identifier":{"display-name":"HTML","target-format":"html"},"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":true,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":false,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"jupyter"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[],"notebook-links":true,"format-links":true},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","css":["../../styles.css"],"output-file":"FastAI_Twitter_Sentiment_Analysis_Tutorial.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.3.78","theme":"cyborg","title-block-banner":true,"title":"Twitter Sentiment Analysis with FastAI","description":"Using open source twitter data to explore sentiment in public debate","date":"09/10/2020","jupyter":"python3","categories":["data-science","nlp"]},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}}}}
