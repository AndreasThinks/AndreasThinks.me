Academic publishing is broken. Research gets locked behind paywalls, trapped in PDFs that nobody reads, and siloed in databases that might vanish when a publisher changes its business model. Peer review happens once, in private, and then the conversation ends. We've had social media for decades, yet science still communicates like it's 1803.

**[Octosphere](https://octosphere.social/)** is my attempt to fix this. It bridges [Octopus](https://octopus.ac/) — a modern publishing platform that breaks research into its component parts — with ATProto, the decentralized protocol behind Bluesky. The result: your research becomes permanent, distributed, and social. Anyone can see it, respond to it, and build on it.

::: {.callout-tip title="Why this matters"}
- **Your publications become eternal and distributed** — not dependent on any single organisation keeping the lights on
- **They reach people where they already are** — in social feeds, not buried in databases
- **Anyone can build on the open data** — new tools, visualisations, and review systems can emerge without permission
:::

This is science the way it should be: collaborative, resilient, and approachable — a digital public square where ideas are welcome and robustly challenged.

## So what's wrong with science now?

Science _should_ be a global feedback loop: ideas shared, tested, challenged, refined. Peer review continuous and welcome. Instead, we've built a system around the academic paper — a format designed for an era when letters took months to arrive.

The paper is the problem:

- **Static and dead on arrival.** You publish once and move on. No iteration, no updates, no living conversation. Science should evolve; papers fossilise.
- **Locked in journals nobody reads.** Written by academics, for academics, behind paywalls. The public funds most research but can't access it.
- **Collaboration stuck in the 1800s.** Want to respond to a paper? Write another paper. Meanwhile, we've watched entire social media platforms rise and fall. Scientists were sharing ideas on Usenet fifty years ago. We can do better.

[Octopus](https://www.octopus.ac/) is a web publishing platform funded by the British Government that aimed to fix a lot of this when it launched. Anybody can publish, and you don't need to share a whole paper: publications are broken down into the components of the scientific method — from hypothesis to analysis to results and beyond. Anybody can review them too: if you disagree with a publication, just post a peer review directly on Octopus.

Octopus is great. But it's also centralised, and doesn't feel hugely approachable. **Science should be (say it quietly) a shared social network. If only we had a tool to build something like that?**

## So how does ATProto help, and why Octosphere?

[ATProto](https://atproto.com/) is the decentralised social media protocol behind Bluesky, and helpfully, is designed to address pretty much this problem — if you want to build a social network for books, or movies, or events, or, you know, _research_, that is decentralised and built collectively rather than relying on infrastructure owned by a single rich man, ATProto will help you do it.

I'm very far from an ATProto expert, so I'm not going to go too deep into it, but in essence: each user has a PDS (Personal Data Server), which hosts their identity and their content. For most people, that's Bluesky, but you can just as well host your own PDS. The magic is that once you've got a PDS, it becomes part of the network — your content is shared across a network of relays, so everyone can see everything, without relying on any one person.

Think of it like email: you can use Gmail, or Outlook, or run your own mail server, but everyone can still message everyone else. ATProto does the same thing for social content — except instead of just text messages, you can share any kind of structured data.

I really like it, but it's a lot less "whole lift" — it doesn't handle auth, or the backend. You absolutely could build this, but as a quick "spin up your social network," ATProto just worked.

And here's where it gets interesting for science: that data can take any shape at all.

In the ATProto world, the shape of your data is defined by a Lexicon — think of it as a schema that describes what a piece of content looks like, what fields it has, and how other applications should interact with it. It acts as data structure, API schema, and validation all at once. If you want to store a blog post, you define a Lexicon for blog posts. If you want to store a scientific publication, you define one for that. You can read [my lexicon for Octopus publications here](https://pdsls.dev/at://did:plc:j5c7tjpwzeqtspmeyviq2eag/com.atproto.lexicon.schema/social.octosphere.publication).

So the cool thing about building on ATProto is how little you need to worry about: you define a lexicon, and help users post your content to the Atmosphere... and that's (mostly) it. ATProto acts as backend, CRUD, and authentication, and you just need to visualise the results.

And that's exactly what Octosphere does. You sign in with your ORCID — the universal researcher identifier — which lets Octosphere find your Octopus publications. It then creates ATProto records for each of them, storing the metadata (title, abstract, type, and link back to the original) as structured data on the ATProtocol network. Optionally, it can cross-post them to your Bluesky feed, so your followers see your work alongside everything else in their timeline.

## So what's cool about this?

A few things, actually.

First, your publications become eternal and distributed. They're not locked behind a paywall, not sitting on a single server, and not dependent on any one organisation keeping the lights on. If Octopus goes down tomorrow, the ATProto records survive across the network's relays. That's a meaningful resilience improvement over the status quo, where decades of research can vanish if a publisher changes its business model or a university cancels a subscription.

Second, it puts science where people already are. Most researchers already have a Bluesky account. Cross-posting publications to that feed means your work reaches people in the spaces they're already checking every day, rather than sitting in a database that only gets visited when someone has a very specific search query. It lowers the barrier between "doing science" and "sharing science" to almost nothing.

Third — and this is the part I'm most excited about — it's a proof of concept for something much bigger. Octosphere is just one app reading one type of record. But because it's built on ATProto, anyone else can build on top of the same data. Someone could build a better visualisation layer, or a recommendation engine, or a peer review tool that references the same publication records. The data is open, the protocol is open, and the ecosystem can grow without anyone's permission.

Science has always been about open exchange of ideas. The publishing system we inherited just forgot that somewhere along the way. Open protocols like ATProto give us a chance to rebuild it properly: decentralised, distributed, and impossible to kill. No single point of failure. No gatekeepers. Just researchers sharing knowledge the way the internet was supposed to work.

Octosphere is a small experiment, but it points toward something bigger. The infrastructure for a truly open scientific commons already exists. We just need to start using it. [Give it a try](https://octosphere.social/).
