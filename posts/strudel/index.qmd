I wanted to embed [Strudel's](https://strudel.cc/) browser-based live coding environment directly into this site. The result is a Quarto extension that loads the Strudel REPL with a CodeMirror editor, collapsible visualisation, and styled play/stop controls.

## Using the Strudel extension

1. Add `- strudel` to the page filters (see the YAML header of this post).
2. Write a code block with the `strudel` language identifier.
3. The extension transforms it into an interactive editor—click Play to hear the pattern and see the visualisation.

## Try it out

Here's an interactive pattern—edit the code below and click Play:

```strudel
note("c3 eb3 g3 bb3")
  .s("sawtooth")
  .cutoff(sine.range(200, 2000).slow(4))
  .room(0.5)
  .gain(0.6)
```

Try changing the notes, the waveform (try `"triangle"` or `"square"`), or tweak the `.slow()` value to alter the filter sweep speed.

## Rhythmic variation

```strudel
every(3, rev, note("<c4 e4 g4 b4>*4"))
  .s("gm_electric_piano_1")
  .jux(x => x.add(note(7)))
  .room(0.4)
  .delay(0.25)
```

This uses `every(3, rev, ...)` to reverse the pattern every third cycle. The `.jux()` function plays the original in one stereo channel and a transposed version in the other.

## How it works

The extension uses [`@strudel/repl`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@strudel/repl) which provides the `<strudel-editor>` web component. Features:

- **Full CodeMirror editor** — syntax highlighting, bracket matching
- **Collapsible visualisation** — hidden when idle, animates open when playing
- **Custom controls** — styled play/stop buttons in a control bar
- **No iframe** — integrates cleanly with the page

## Ambient textures

```strudel
note("c2 g2 c3 e3".slow(2))
  .s("sawtooth")
  .cutoff(perlin.range(100, 800).slow(8))
  .decay(0.5)
  .sustain(0.3)
  .room(0.8)
  .stack(
    note("c5 e5 g5".slow(4))
      .s("triangle")
      .gain(0.3)
      .delay(0.5)
  )
```

This combines a bass line with upper harmonics using `.stack()`. The perlin noise slowly modulates the filter for an evolving texture.
