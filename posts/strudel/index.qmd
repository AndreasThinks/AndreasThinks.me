I wanted a way to sprinkle Strudel's browser-based live coding on this site without hand-wiring scripts on every post. The result is a tiny Quarto extension that automatically loads Strudel from the CDN, wraps any `strudel` code blocks with play/stop buttons, and keeps the cyberpunk styling intact.

## Using the Strudel extension

1. Add `- strudel` to the page filters (the header of this post shows the YAML needed).
2. Write a code block with the `strudel` language. The extension will attach controls and call `evaluate(...)` under the hood when someone hits play.
3. Click play to initialize Strudel (per browser autoplay rules this needs a user gesture) and enjoy the pattern; hit stop to hush everything.

Here's a quick pattern demo to try:

```strudel
every(3, rev, note("c4 g4 e4 a4").fast(2))
  .sometimesBy(0.4, jux(rev))
  .slow(1.5)
```

If you want to load in your own samples or do something more elaborate, you can still call `evaluate` directly from a `strudel` block—the extension simply gives you a friendly wrapper and makes sure Strudel is initialized once per page.
