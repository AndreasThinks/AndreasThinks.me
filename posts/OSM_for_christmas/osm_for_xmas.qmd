In the eternal words of The Thick of it, [everything that happens in the world has to happen somewhere](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Quotes/TheThickOfIt). It sounds obvious, but so many good pieces of research or analysis forget just how much **where you are matters**...and that's why, this christmas, I've spent an inordinate amount of time contributing to [Open Street Map](https://www.openstreetmap.org/).

I still remember when I first got really excited about OSM - we were doing some analysis on how to identify a town centre, and needed data on where every single cash machine in the capital was. Now, that's a tough problem - banks move them pretty regularly, so short of asking them (or paying Mr and Ms Google), it's actually a pretty thorny problem to get to the bottom of. Unless you just ask OpenStreetMap, in which case up to date, surprisingly high-quality data is [only an API call away](https://overpass-turbo.eu/s/1F3S). 

![Ever wanted to know where all the ATMs in London are?](atms.png)

But OSM isn't some flashy, perfect effort by some faceless corporation: it's entirely open-souce, with each ATM, building, fire-hydrant and tree painstakingly placed by evvery day people like you...and me. I'm aware I could just use Google Maps for so much of this stuff, and I risk coming across as some ageing techno-hippy, but I honestly think what the OSM community have achieved is one of the great wonders of the internet - wonderful mapping, available to all for everything from day to day [navigation](https://organicmaps.app/) to [humanitarian aid](https://www.hotosm.org/), a communal effort rivalling Wikipedia at [a fraction of the cost](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenStreetMap_Foundation).

And the final cherry on top?  Contributing to OSM is *fun*. I've always loved efforts to gamify moving through the real world (from [Pokemon Go](https://pokemongolive.com/) to [Zombies, Run!](https://zrx.app/)). So if you're looking for some wholesome Christmas fun that will get you moving, *and* contribute to some real good, [try making a few contributions](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Beginners%27_guide).

![The full OSM editor, which isn't nearly as scary as it looks](osm_editor.png)

In case I've inspired you, here are the tools I found really got me started:

1. [StreetComplete](https://streetcomplete.app/?lang=en) - the easiest, smoothest, most gamified OSM experience you can get. This whole app is honestly delightful - just open it up as you walk around, and I'll guarantee you'll feel like you've achieved something useful in only a few minutes.
2. [EveryDoor](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Every_Door) - If you've played with StreetComplete, and feel ready to step it up a notch, this app is a great way to get most of the detail of OSM without too much friction.
3. [The full OSM editor!](https://www.openstreetmap.org/) Honestly, I spent so long feeling like the proper editor wasn't for me - I'm a newbie enthusiast, not a surveyor - but honestly, I could not have been more wrong. There's an interactive tutorial and everything. 

So this Christmas, why not do some good, and go map some stuff!
