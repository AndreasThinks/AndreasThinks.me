# Statistics 101 for Evaluation

> *"Understanding uncertainty is the foundation of credible impact measurement."*

This session built statistical intuition for evaluation, exploring how to **design rigorous studies**, **interpret results correctly**, and **communicate findings confidently**. Rather than memorizing formulas, we developed mental models that connect directly to decisions you'll make in civic tech evaluation.

## Session Summary

### 📊 Distributions, Sample Sizes & Variance

We explored why **variation is normal** and how understanding distributions helps distinguish signal from noise.

::: {.callout-important}
## Key Insight: The Law of Large Numbers
As sample size grows, your estimate gets more stable and accurate.

**Formula:** Uncertainty ∝ 1/√n

This means to cut uncertainty in half, you need 4× more data.
:::

**What we covered:**

- **Distributions** describe how outcomes vary across repeated observations
- **Sample size** determines how confident we are about the true value
- **Variance** (σ²) measures spread — higher variance means more data needed
- The **Central Limit Theorem** explains why averages tend to look Normal, enabling inference

::: {.callout-tip icon=false}
## 💡 Practical Example
A council launches a redesigned service form. Daily completion rates bounce between 38-56%. Is this noise or signal?

**Answer:** Without understanding the distribution and sample size, you can't tell. You need to collect enough data for the sampling distribution to stabilize.
:::

**Interactive Demo:** We used the **Sampling Distribution Explorer** to see how the sampling distribution tightens as n increases, demonstrating the √n scaling relationship.

---

### 🎯 P-Values, Confidence Intervals & Significance

We learned how to formally test whether an observed difference is real, and why **confidence intervals are better than p-values** alone.

::: {.callout-important}
## Key Distinction
**p-value:** If the null hypothesis were true, how surprising is this data?
**Confidence interval:** A range of plausible effect sizes, showing both magnitude and precision.
:::

**What we covered:**

- The **null hypothesis** (H₀) is your skeptical starting point
- **Standard error** measures uncertainty in your estimate
- **Type I errors** (false positives, α) vs **Type II errors** (false negatives, β)
- **95% confidence intervals** tell you the range of plausible effects

::: {.callout-warning}
## The Danger of p-Hacking
With α = 0.05, pure chance gives you 1 false positive per 20 tests!

**Common forms:**
- Testing many outcomes, reporting only "significant" ones
- Analyzing by multiple subgroups until something "works"
- Stopping data collection when p < 0.05

**Prevention:** Pre-register your analysis plan before collecting data.
:::

**Interactive Demo:** The **A/B Testing Simulator** showed how Type I error (false positives) and statistical power (true positives) change with sample size and effect size.

**Key Takeaway:** Report effect sizes with confidence intervals, not just p-values. A "significant" effect might be too small to matter; a "non-significant" effect might be important but underpowered.

---

### ⚡ Power Calculations & Study Design

We explored how to **design studies with enough power** to detect real effects, and why this planning must happen **before** data collection.

::: {.callout-important}
## What Is Power?
**Statistical power:** Probability you'll detect a real effect if it exists (1 - β)

**Common target:** 80% power

**The relationship:**
- Smaller effects → need larger sample size
- Higher power → need larger sample size
- Lower α → need larger sample size
:::

**What we covered:**

- **Minimum Detectable Effect (MDE):** The smallest effect your study can reliably detect
- **Power-sample size relationship:** n grows with 1/(effect size)² — half the effect = 4× the sample
- **Design principle:** Match your MDE to your practical significance threshold
- What to do when sample size is **constrained** (reduce variance, adjust design, be honest about limitations)

::: {.callout-tip icon=false}
## 💡 Practical Example
You plan an SMS reminder to reduce missed appointments (currently 42%). Goal: detect a −3pp improvement.

**Question:** How many people per arm do we need?
**Answer:** ~1,370 per arm (2,740 total) for 80% power at α=0.05

This surprises many people! Small effects need large samples.
:::

**Interactive Demo:** The **Power & Sample Size Calculator** showed how required n changes with different MDE, power, and α settings.

**Key Takeaway:** Don't run underpowered studies. Calculate required sample size for the minimum effect that would change your decision, and be transparent about what effects you can and cannot detect.

---

### 📈 Regression & Looking Backwards

We learned how **regression helps control for confounders** and estimate adjusted treatment effects, allowing us to understand what happened in observational data.

::: {.callout-important}
## What Is Regression?
Regression models the relationship between an outcome and predictor variables, estimating the effect of each variable while holding others constant.

**Formula:** y = β₀ + β₁·Treatment + β₂·Age + β₃·Mobile + ε

**β₁** = effect of treatment, adjusting for age and device
:::

**What we covered:**

- **Interpreting coefficients:** Each β is the effect of that variable, assuming all others stay the same
- **Key assumptions:** Linearity, exogeneity (no unmeasured confounders), no collinearity, homoskedasticity
- **Robust standard errors:** Use clustered SEs when outcomes within groups are correlated
- **Diagnostics:** Check residual plots, Q-Q plots, and leverage to validate assumptions
- **R² measures fit, not validity:** Focus on β estimates and their precision, not R²
- **Interactions:** When treatment effects differ by subgroup

::: {.callout-warning}
## The Confounding Problem
Regression only adjusts for variables you **include**. If there's an unmeasured confounder (e.g., motivation, prior interest), your estimate can still be biased.

**Solution:** Better study design (RCT), natural experiments, or transparent acknowledgment of limitations.
:::

**Key Takeaway:** Regression is a powerful tool for observational data and improving precision in experiments, but it's not a substitute for good design. Always be transparent about potential unmeasured confounders.

---

### 🔄 Bayesian Approaches to Inference

We explored how **Bayesian statistics offers a different paradigm** for thinking about uncertainty and evidence.

::: {.callout-important}
## The Paradigm Shift
**Frequentist:** "Given a true parameter, what's the probability of this data?"
**Bayesian:** "Given this data, what's the probability distribution of the parameter?"

This enables direct probability statements about parameters.
:::

**What we covered:**

- **Bayes' Theorem:** Prior belief + new evidence → updated belief
- **Posterior = Prior × Likelihood / Evidence**
- **Credible intervals** (Bayesian) vs **confidence intervals** (frequentist)
- **Prior selection:** Uninformative, weakly informative, or informative priors
- **When Bayesian helps:** Small samples, sequential testing, decision analysis, complex models

::: {.callout-tip icon=false}
## 💡 Key Difference
**95% Confidence Interval (frequentist):**
"If we repeated the study many times, 95% of intervals would contain the true parameter"

**95% Credible Interval (Bayesian):**
"There's a 95% probability the parameter is in this interval, given our data and prior"

The Bayesian interpretation is what most people intuitively want!
:::

**Key Takeaway:** Both paradigms have strengths. Use frequentist for standard evaluations where methods are established. Use Bayesian when you have good priors, small samples, or need direct decision probabilities.

## 🎓 Cross-Cutting Lessons

### Common Evaluation Pitfalls

1. **Multiple comparisons** without correction → inflated false positive rate
2. **p-hacking** → testing many things, only reporting "significant" ones
3. **Regression to the mean** → targeting worst performers who improve anyway
4. **Measurement drift** → definition changes over time
5. **Ignoring clustering** → standard errors too small, false positives

**Prevention:** Pre-register analysis plans, use robust methods, be transparent.

---

### Good Practice Checklist

✅ **Design phase:**
- Pre-register primary outcomes and analysis plan
- Calculate required sample size (power analysis)
- Plan for covariates to adjust for

✅ **Analysis phase:**
- Report effect sizes with confidence intervals
- Use robust/clustered SEs where appropriate
- Check diagnostics (residual plots, balance checks)
- Don't p-hack (stick to pre-specified analyses)

✅ **Reporting phase:**
- Transparent about limitations
- Share data and code where possible
- Plain-language interpretation
- Acknowledge what you DON'T know
