## Introduction

- **Importance of Evaluation**:
  - Demonstrates impact, accountability, and guides improvements.
- **Treatment Effect**:
  - Measures causal impact of interventions.

---

## Why Evaluation Matters

- Crucial for funding and credibility.
- Essential for learning and continuous improvement.
- Helps organizations focus resources effectively.

## Treatment Effects: Why They Matter

- Shows causal impact, not just correlation.
- Essential for effective decision-making and resource allocation.

## Challenges: Correlation vs Causation

- Correlation ≠ causation.
- Importance of a counterfactual (control group).

**Example:**
- Youth employment improvements might coincide with economic growth, not just program impact.

## Rigorous Methods: Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs)

- Gold standard for impact evaluation.
- Participants randomly assigned (treatment/control).

**UK Example:**
- [Family Nurse Partnership Scotland Evaluation](https://www.gov.scot/publications/evaluation-family-nurse-partnership-scotland/)

## Rigorous Alternatives: Quasi-Experimental

- When RCTs aren't feasible.
- Propensity score matching, difference-in-differences, regression discontinuity.

**Case Study:** Family Nurse Partnership (FNP), Scotland, using natural timing differences as controls.

## Case Study 1: Read Easy UK

- Volunteer-led adult literacy improvement.
- Personal narratives (e.g., Jay Blades).

> *“Over 200 adults gained literacy skills through personalized coaching, enabling life-changing improvements.”*

## Case Study: Code Club

- Free coding clubs for children aged 9-13.
- Over 90% improved in confidence and problem-solving.

**Narrative:** *“Code Club transforms children's lives by boosting digital skills and creativity, reaching over 200,000 young people globally.”*

## Case Study: Skills for Life Strategy

- Massive UK adult literacy and numeracy initiative.
- Despite extensive investment, numeracy levels declined.

**Lesson:** Outputs don't guarantee outcomes. Importance of targeting and meaningful metrics.

## Case Study: Sure Start

- Integrated child services for disadvantaged families.
- Initial evaluations found minimal impact; long-term studies showed significant positive outcomes.

**Narrative:** *Early struggles can lead to later successes; patience and continued evaluation essential.*

## Famous Failure: D.A.R.E.

- Popular anti-drug education program.
- Rigorous evaluations showed no effect on drug use.

**Lesson:** Popular ≠ effective. Importance of evidence-based design.

## Qualitative vs Quantitative

- **Quantitative:** Numbers, measurable outcomes.
- **Qualitative:** Stories, feedback, context.

**Best Practice:** Use both to tell a comprehensive story.

## Selecting Metrics

- Outcomes vs outputs.
- SMART criteria (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound).

**Example of Good Metrics:**
- Percentage increase in civic participation.
- Long-term housing retention for homeless interventions.

## Summary & Key Takeaways

- Evaluation demonstrates impact and drives improvement.
- Treatment effects require rigorous methods.
- Effective communication combines data and storytelling.
- Avoid common pitfalls with clear planning and meaningful metrics.

## Q&A and Discussion

- Your experiences?
- How could these concepts apply to your projects?
