# Welcome!

## Aims for today

- Introduction to the module content
- Some group decisions
- A case study from me

## About Me

- Operational policing and crime background
- Lots of work around community tech innovation
- Focus on impact evaluation
- Now work in central govt

# Module Overview

## Module Aims

- Focus is **not** on building innovation (covered in plenty of other modules)
- Instead, we'll look at **how to implement innovation** (and when it fails)
  - Implementation and delivery
  - Pushback, internal and external
  - Incentives and pushback
  - Implementation delivery challenges that can kill good ideas.

## Linked Modules

- There are several other modules that will touch on topics touched here. 
  - [Institutional Analysis](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ezGpso8ybfX-6qmH6LVd495xEWCwiNHLW4jKJYoWkks/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.x14ba9dm4sw2)

  - and more!

  - Evaluation masterclass next year?

## Structure

- **Attend Meetups and Events**: I'll mantain a list of government innovation associated meetups. You should attend at least 1 of these, and share notes and reflections with the group
- **Case Study Discussion Sessions**: As a group, we'll select 2-3 examples of innovation as case studies, to read up and discuss 
- **Online Discussion Platform**: Space for ongoing conversations, article sharing, and reflection.

# Decisions for today!

## Online Content

- Where do you want online stuff?
  - Slack
  - Discord
  - WhatsApp
  - Others?
- Consider what works best for interaction, notifications, and accessibility.

## In Person - Where and When?

- I'll aim to pencil in the next event for the end of this year.
- Every 6-8 weeks?
- Case studies 4 weeks in advance

## Case Studies

- I'll suggest a few interesting case studies...
- But you should also come up with your own!
- We'll aim to select the first in the next couple of weeks

# Case Studies

## Finding case studies

- I've listed a few potential case studies in the module guide. These include
  - GOV.UK
  - NHS Horizon
  - Healthcare.gov
  - X-Road
- but I'd encourage you to think beyond the technical! For example...

## Case Study 1 - Sortition in Ancient Athens

---

### Sortition in Ancient Athens

  - Innovation: Random selection of officials.
  - Time Period: Classical Athens, circa 5th century BCE.
  - Aim: Reduce the power of elites and increase representation.
- **Why It Was Innovative**: Sortition was a radical approach to ensure equal opportunity and fairness, promoting democracy by reducing elite influence.
- **Outcome**: Despite its democratic intent, sortition faced significant resistance from powerful elites and gradually faded as societies favored expertise and elections over random selection.

## Case Study 2 - Pneumatic Tube Mail Systems

---

### Pneumatic Tube Mail Systems

  - Innovation: Pneumatic tubes for fast mail delivery.
  - Time Period: Late 19th to early 20th century.
  - Cities: New York, Paris, London.
- **Why It Was Innovative**: The pneumatic tube system was an exciting and novel way to move mail quickly, reflecting significant ingenuity in urban logistics.
- **Outcome**: The system eventually became obsolete due to rising mail volumes and the advent of better communication technologies, such as telephones and electronic mail.

## Case Study 3 - Metric System Implementation in the U.S.

---

### Metric System Implementation in the U.S.

  - Innovation: Standardized metric system.
  - Aim: Align U.S. with global measurement systems.
  - Challenges: Cultural resistance.
- **Why It Was Innovative**: The metric system offered a universal, rational standard that could have streamlined commerce, science, and daily life.
- **Outcome**: Despite its advantages, the metric system faced strong cultural resistance in the U.S., where the familiarity and tradition of customary units prevailed, leading to only partial adoption.

## Case Study 4 - Proportional Representation in the UK 

---

### Proportional Representation in the UK

  - Innovation: Align vote percentages with seat allocation.
  - Aim: Fairer electoral representation.
  - Challenges: Political resistance.
- **Why It Was Innovative**: PR aimed to provide a more equitable electoral system, ensuring that the representation in government matched the popular vote more closely.
- **Outcome**: The introduction of PR faced significant resistance from entrenched political interests that benefited from the existing first-past-the-post system, leading to limited adoption in the UK.
