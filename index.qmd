I'm Andreas, [a data scientist and public safety researcher working to improve the use of data and evidence in government](https://andreasthinks.me/about.html). I enjoy [coordinating exciting communities](https://lu.ma/ai-for-good), and working with [fantastic](https://newspeak.house/) [institutions](https://ai.gov.uk/) to build projects that improve the world, including [teaching on public sector innovation at Newspeak House](slides/index.qmd).
