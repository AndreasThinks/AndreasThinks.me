I'm Andreas Varotsis, a data scientist and public safety researcher working to improve the use of data and evidence in government.I try to use an empirical approach and multi-disciplinary, quantitative tools to understand, diagnose, and build solutions for critical problems around public cohesion, society and public safety.

I also enjoy [coordinating exciting communities](https://lu.ma/ai-for-good), and working with [fantastic](https://newspeak.house/) [institutions](https://ai.gov.uk/) to build projects that improve the world.

My particular areas of interest are:

- data-science and machine learning
- crime and police activity in physical space
- econometrics and economic modelling
- experimental and quasi-experimental testing
- rapid technological solutions and innovation

I use this site to showcase [my recent work](recent_work.qmd), and discuss [new data-science and statistical tools and techniques on my blog](https://andreasthinks.me/).

If you'd like to chat, hear more, or absolutely anything else, [on Matrix](https://matrix.to/#/@andreas.thinks:matrix.org) or by [email.](mailto:andreas.varotsis@gmail.com)
