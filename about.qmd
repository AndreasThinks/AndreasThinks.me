I'm Andreas Varotsis. I work to improve how governments use data and evidence to address critical challenges in public safety and social cohesion. As a data scientist and public safety researcher, I draw on empirical, multi-disciplinary, and quantitative approaches to understand and build solutions for these problems. Since 2025, I've been doing this work at [Palantir](https://www.palantir.com), focused on government and public sector initiatives.

I also enjoy [coordinating exciting communities](https://lu.ma/ai-for-good), and working with [fantastic](https://newspeak.house/) [institutions](https://ai.gov.uk/) to build projects that improve the world.

My particular areas of interest are:

- data-science and machine learning
- crime and police activity in physical space
- econometrics and economic modelling
- experimental and quasi-experimental testing
- rapid technological solutions and innovation

I use this site to showcase [my recent work](recent_work.qmd), and discuss [new data-science and statistical tools and techniques on my blog](https://andreasthinks.me/).

If you'd like to chat, hear more, or absolutely anything else, [on Matrix](https://matrix.to/#/@andreas.thinks:matrix.org) or by [email.](mailto:andreas.varotsis@gmail.com)
