# Project Update Overview

## Summary
- Established a neon terminal-inspired visual language featuring dark backgrounds, glowing accents, and monospace typography across the site.
- Rebuilt the homepage hero with `.intro-panel` wrappers so Andreas' introduction and portrait sit naturally side-by-side without excess whitespace.
- Refined blog listings, cards, and interactive elements to better fill available space and maintain the cyberpunk terminal aesthetic.
- Tuned Quarto configuration to disable auto tables of contents, open external links in new tabs, and better support the custom styling experience.

## Testing & Tooling
- Verified the site builds and renders locally with `quarto check` and `quarto preview` during the redesign iterations.

## Next Steps Ideas
- Consider extending the terminal motif to slides and other Quarto documents for complete brand cohesion.
- Explore subtle animated accents (e.g., scanning cursor, grid glow) to further emphasize the sci-fi inspiration while keeping performance in mind.
